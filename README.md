### Previewing Your README.md

After adding the badges, preview your `README.md` on GitHub to ensure the badges are displayed correctly. Adjust the badge styles or logos if necessary by referring to [shields.io](https://shields.io/) for customization options.

By following these steps, you can create a visually appealing and informative `README.md` file for your GitHub repository.
